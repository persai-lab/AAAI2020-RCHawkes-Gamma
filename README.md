# AAAI2020-RCHawkes-Gamma
## Introduction:
Motivated by the problem of detecting and predicting student procrastination in students Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) with missing and partially observed data, in this work, we propose a novel personalized Hawkes process model RCHawkes-Gamma that discovers meaningful student behavior clusters by jointly learning all partially observed processes simultaneously, without relying on auxiliary features.
